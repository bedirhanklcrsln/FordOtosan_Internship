# Freespace Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)  
  
    	
### *Machine Learning*
Machine learning is learning the algorithm by using the data it has.
### *Unsupervised vs Supervised learning difference*  
In supervised learning, we give labeled data to the machine so that it can use them while grouping objects.  
In unsupervised learning, objects are grouped by comparing their various properties to each other.  
### *Deep Learning*
It is a subfield of machine learning that uses one or more artificial neural networks to obtain new data using labeled data.
### *Neural Network*
It is a machine learning algorithm that works like a human brain.
### *Convolution Neural Network*
It is a deep learning algorithm. it increases the accuracy of object detection by filtering the image.  
Advantages over NN: high accuracy , weight sharing.
### *Segmentation Task in Neural Network*
Segmentation is classify the pixels in the image where the object is located , both supervised and unsupervised.
### *Classification Task in Neural Network*
Classification is the classification of the image according to the object in the image , it is supervised.
### *Comparing Classification and Segmentation*
Classification gives class to the image. segmentation classifies parts of the image
### *Data and Dataset difference*
Data is processed or unprocessed information. A dataset is a collection of data collected for a specific purpose.
### *Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised learning in terms of Dataset*
Supervised learning uses dataset but Unsupervised does not use dataset.
### *Color Space*
Color space is a defined range of colors
### *RGB*
It is the digital combination of red, blue and green colors with various proportions
### *In python , can we transform from one color space to another?*
Yes , we can with cvtColor() function
### *Popular library for image processing*
OpenCV
OpenCV is one of the most popular image-processing libraries. It is used for implementing computer vision algorithms and performing machine learning and image processing. In addition, it is available for free and is open-source
### *Computational Graph*
A computational graph is a directed graph where the nodes correspond to operations or variables.They are a form of directed graphs that represent a mathematical expression.
### *Tensor*
Tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes scalars, vectors, and matrices into higher-dimensional spaces.
### *One Hot Encoding*
One hot encoding is a way of representing categorical values in a numerical way
### *CUDA programming*
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs).
### *Difference CNN and FCNN*
A fully connected neural network is a neural network where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. In contrast, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network where one or more of the layers employs a convolution as the function applied to the output of the previous layer.
### *Different layers on CNN*
convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully-connected (FC) layers.
### *Activation funciton*
Decides whether a neuron should be activated or no.The softmax function is often used as the last activation function of a neural network to normalize the output of a network to a probability distribution
### *Parameters*
In neural networks, parameters are the weights of the connections between neurons.
### *Hyperparameters*
Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before starting the model training process
### *Validation Dataset*
Validation dataset tells us how well the model is learning and adapting,
### *Epoch*
Epoch is refers to one cycle through the full training dataset.
### *Batch*
Batch is running repetitive processes automatically
### *Iteration*
Iteration is a repetition of something
example : prime number determination
### *Cost Function*
Cost function  calculates the performance of the machine learning model
### *Optimizers purpose*
In NN , optimizers purpose is reduce loss
### *Batch Gradient Descent*
Batch Gradient Descent calculates over the entire training set at each step
### *Stochastic Gradient Descent* 
Stochastic Gradient Descent calculates with a random value in the training set at each step
Stochastic Gradient Descent is faster and less computationally expensive than Batch Gradient Descent
### *Backpropogation*
Backpropogation is the algorithm that works to test for errors from output nodes to input nodes
