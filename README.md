# Freespace Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)  
  
    	
### *Machine Learning*
Machine learning is learning the algorithm by using the data it has.
### *Unsupervised vs Supervised learning difference*  
In supervised learning, we give labeled data to the machine so that it can use them while grouping objects.  
In unsupervised learning, objects are grouped by comparing their various properties to each other.  
### *Deep Learning*
It is a subfield of machine learning that uses one or more artificial neural networks to obtain new data using labeled data.
### *Neural Network*
It is a machine learning algorithm that works like a human brain.
### *Convolution Neural Network*
It is a deep learning algorithm. it increases the accuracy of object detection by filtering the image.  
Advantages over NN: high accuracy , weight sharing.
### *Segmentation Task in Neural Network*
Segmentation is classify the pixels in the image where the object is located , both supervised and unsupervised.
### *Classification Task in Neural Network*
Classification is the classification of the image according to the object in the image , it is supervised.
### *Comparing Classification and Segmentation*
Classification gives class to the image. segmentation classifies parts of the image
### *Data and Dataset difference*
Data is processed or unprocessed information. A dataset is a collection of data collected for a specific purpose.
### *Difference between Supervised and Unsupervised learning in terms of Dataset*
Supervised learning uses dataset but Unsupervised does not use dataset.
